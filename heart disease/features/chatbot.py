**Prediction Explanation:**

Your heart disease risk assessment shows a **{prob:.1f}% probability**, which is categorized as **{risk_cat}**.

**What this means:**
- This prediction is based on analysis of multiple risk factors using advanced machine learning models
- Higher probability indicates increased likelihood, not a diagnosis
- Many risk factors can be modified through lifestyle changes

**Key Factors Considered:**
- Age and biological factors
- Blood pressure levels
- Cholesterol levels
- Lifestyle factors (smoking, exercise, diet)
- Medical history (diabetes, family history)

**Next Steps:**
{risk_assessment.get('recommendation', 'Consult with healthcare provider')}

**Remember:** This tool is for educational purposes. Always consult with qualified healthcare professionals for medical decisions.
